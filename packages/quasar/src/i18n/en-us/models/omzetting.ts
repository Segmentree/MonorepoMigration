  faq: {
    header: 'Frequently asked questions',
    q1: 'What is a conversion to a BV?',
    a1:
      'You can turn your sole proprietorship or general partnership into a BV. The main reasons for this are the limited liability of the BV, the tax advantages and the attractiveness of the BV for investors.',
    q2:
      'Why convert your sole proprietorship or general partnership into a BV?',
    a2:
      'The main reason for converting your sole proprietorship or general partnership into a BV is liability. With a sole proprietorship or general partnership, you as the owner or partner are fully liable for your business. This means that if your sole proprietorship or general partnership goes bankrupt, any creditors can access your private assets. In addition, with a BV you have to pay less tax from high profits than with a sole proprietorship or general partnership. In a sole proprietorship or general partnership, you pay income tax. The more profit you make, the more you will have to relinquish to the tax authorities. At the BV you pay both income and corporation tax. You still end up lower. This is because the added percentage is less than the single percentage of the income tax.',
    q3:
      'When is it advisable to convert your sole proprietorship or general partnership into a BV?',
    a3:
      'We always recommend converting your sole proprietorship or general partnership to the BV if your profit is €80,000 or more. This way you have to pay much less tax. In addition, it is wise to think about converting to a BV if your sole proprietorship or general partnership is active in a risky market. For example, you can think of taking on a large assignment for a multinational. When things go wrong, can you bear the consequences yourself? The big advantage of a BV is that you cannot be held liable for any debts yourself. The assets of your BV and your private assets are separated. This is not the case with a sole proprietorship or general partnership and your car, house or bank accounts are at risk. Therefore, always ask yourself whether you can still vouch for the consequences when your sole proprietorship or general partnership grows.',
    q4:
      'How do you convert a sole proprietorship or general partnership into a BV?',
    a4:
      'There are three different ways to turn your sole proprietorship or general partnership into a BV, namely: the asset-liability transaction and the silent or noiseless contribution. Which method of conversion is most suitable for you must be determined by a registered accountant or tax specialist. Therefore, always consult with your chartered accountant or tax specialist to ensure that your conversion can go smoothly and that you do not run into problems with the tax authorities.',
    q5: 'Why do you need a registered accountant or tax specialist?',
    a5:
      'De register accountant of fiscalist dient jou op basis van jouw financiële stukken te adviseren over de meest geschikte vorm van omzetting. Daarnaast zal de accountant bij ruisende en geruisloze inbreng ook een inbrengbeschrijving moeten opmaken. Zonder deze beschrijving kan de notaris niet van start. Ook zal je accountant de omzetting kunnen afstemmen met de Belastingdienst, zodat je onnodige boetes en naheffingen voorkomt. Als je geen register accountant of fiscalist bij de omzetting betrekt, loop je een groot risico op vertraging in de omzettingsprocedure. Ook moet een omzetting vaak achteraf gecorrigeerd worden, doordat er fouten zijn gemaakt in het opstellen van de stukken. Dit soort procedures zijn erg kostbaar. Om te voorkomen dat je tegen dit soort vervelende problemen aanloopt, stelt Ligo de betrokkenheid van een accountant of fiscalist verplicht bij de omzetting.',
    q6: 'What does retroactive incorporation mean?',
    a6:
      'Converting your BV with retroactive effect means that the Tax and Customs Administration allocates all income from your sole proprietorship or general partnership with retroactive effect to your BV. This way you ensure that your profit is taxed at the advantageous corporate tax rates.',
    q7:
      'What steps do I have to take to convert my sole proprietorship or general partnership?',
    a7: {
      text1:
        'We briefly explain the process for you in the step-by-step plan for conversion to BV:',
      item1:
        '1. Consult with your chartered accountant or tax specialist: discuss which method of conversion is most suitable. Not a registered accountant or tax specialist? Request a free intake interview at Ligo. We can arrange this for you at an affordable price.',
      item2:
        '2. Send your letter of intent to the tax authorities in good time: if you opt for noiseless or silent input, you must send your request in good time. Make sure you do this together with your chartered accountant or tax specialist.',
      item3:
        '3. Answer the online questionnaire for converting your sole proprietorship or general partnership: a conversion to a BV is very simple. At Ligo you can enter your details online. Need help filling out? Feel free to ask our lawyers your questions in the chat.',
      item4:
        '4. View your draft deed and upload your documents: after completing the questionnaire it is immediately possible to view your draft deed and upload the documents required for the civil-law notaries. Is there a silent or rustling input? Keep in mind that the civil-law notary also needs an input description from your registered accountant or tax specialist.',
      item5:
        '5. Identification at notary: there are 2 options to identify yourself. You identify yourself during a video call with the notary, or you visit the notary.',
      item6:
        '6. Conversion to BV and registration with the Chamber of Commerce: after your approval and signing of your deed by the civil-law notary, your BV is officially established. After this, the notary will register your BV with the Chamber of Commerce.'
    },
    q8:
      'How much does it cost to convert a sole proprietorship or general partnership into a BV?',
    a8:
      "However, we provide a quick and affordable process, so that you don't have to worry about paperwork and can quickly start your business. You can convert your sole proprietorship or general partnership into a BV for as little as €299 (all notarial costs are included here)."
