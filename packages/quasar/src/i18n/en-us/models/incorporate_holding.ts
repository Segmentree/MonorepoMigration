With a simple holding structure, you as a natural person own 100% of the shares in the (personal) holding company. The holding company then again holds the shares in the work BV.',

      'It is strongly recommended for several reasons to immediately set up a holding company next to your BV. For example, the holding company offers many tax advantages. With the help of the holding company you can also easily secure the capital that is built up in the work BV in the holding company itself. In this way you do not run the risk of losing valuable assets, such as trademark rights or a well-functioning website, in the event of bankruptcy. Knowing more?

      'If you do not live in the Netherlands, it is still possible to incorporate a holding. However, as you’re not registered in the Municipal Personal Records Database (in Dutch: the BRP), the notary needs additional documents to confirm your home address. For example, a recent gas / light or water bill. In addition, the holding must be registered at a Dutch business address. Furthermore, it is important for the Dutch Tax Authorities that your holding carries out actual business activities in the Netherlands. For that reason, the Dutch Tax Authorities require that your holding has a Dutch bank account. Also, all board decisions must be made in the Netherlands and the holdings’ turnover must go through a Dutch bank account.',
