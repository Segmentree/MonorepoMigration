  faq: {
    item_1_title: 'What is a foundation?',
    item_1_text:
      'A foundation is a form of enterprise that has been established to pursue a social or societal goal, for example. This social or societal purpose predominates in everything the foundation does. Making a profit will therefore never be the main goal of the foundation. For example, foundations include museums and charities.',
    item_2_title: 'When is a foundation the legal form for me?',
    item_2_text:
      'If you want to pursue a social or societal goal with your company, you can set up a foundation. This makes you eligible for certain grant and/or fund applications.',
    item_3_title: 'What does the board of a foundation look like?',
    item_3_text:
      'The board of a foundation consists of at least a chairman, secretary and treasurer. The chairman is the face of the foundation. He represents the foundation on official matters and presides over the meetings. The secretary is the writer of the group. He takes care of the minutes of the meetings and keeps track of the actions of the board. After all, the treasurer is responsible for all financial affairs of the foundation.',
    item_4_title: 'Am I liable as a director of a foundation?',
    item_4_text:
      'Not in principle. Because the foundation is a legal person, the foundation itself will be liable for obligations. The foundation itself enters into contracts. An exception to this is mismanagement. This is not going to happen anytime soon. Consider, for example, a fraudulent driver.',
    item_5_title: 'How many directors should the foundation have at least?',
    item_5_text:
      "A foundation may have one director. One person will then be the chairman, secretary and treasurer. Nevertheless, we recommend that you always opt for at least two drivers. Notaries conduct longer and stricter investigations when setting up foundations with a single board. The reason for this is that if the board consists of only one director, the risk of fraud is much higher due to the lack of mutual control between directors. In that case, the continuity' of your foundation is also less well guaranteed, because the foundation is then completely dependent on you.",
    item_6_title: 'Does the foundation have to pay taxes?',
    item_6_text:
      'A foundation can sometimes be seen as a company by the tax authorities. In that case, the foundation must pay corporation tax. Whether this is the case depends on the facts and circumstances. The activities of a foundation play a major role in determining whether a foundation is seen as a company.',
    item_7_title: 'When does the foundation pay no tax?',
    item_7_text:
      "In certain cases, a foundation does not have to pay tax. This is the case if the taxable profit in a year does not exceed €15,000. In addition, you do not have to pay tax if the taxable profit in one year and the preceding four years has not been more than € 75.00. Would you like to know more about the foundation's tax obligations and deductible items? Contact us via our online chat or via 020-3031043.",
    item_8_title: 'Can I receive a salary from the foundation?',
    item_8_text:
      "Yes, you can be an employee of your foundation as a director. This doesn't happen very often. In practice, as a director, you often only receive an expense allowance. Please note, do you have an ANBI foundation? In that case, you as a director may not receive a salary.",
    item_9_title: 'Can the foundation make a profit?',
    item_9_text:
      'Yes, you can make a profit with a foundation. This profit should only be used to achieve the goal of the foundation. You may not distribute the profit to the directors.',

    item_11_title:
      'Do I have to register my foundation with the Chamber of Commerce and what are the costs?',
    item_11_text:
      "A foundation must be registered with the Chamber of Commerce (KvK). The notary will arrange this registration for you, so you don't have to worry about it. The Chamber of Commerce charges a one-off fee of €50 for each company for the administrative actions. You will receive this invoice afterwards at the address of your foundation.",
    item_12_title: 'How do I set up a foundation?',
    item_12_text:
      'A notary is always involved in the establishment of a foundation. A notarial deed is required to establish your foundation. In practice, a notarial deed can entail high costs. At Ligo, however, we have made the processes more efficient with the help of smart software, so that starting your company does not have to be expensive at all.

    item_14_text:
      "The foundation must be established with a notarial deed of incorporation, so you have to go to the notary. However, we provide a quick and affordable process, so that you don't have to worry about paperwork and can quickly start your business. You can set up a foundation from €339 (all notarial costs are included here).",

      'Do you want to organize your board differently, for example by means of a one-tier or a two-tier board? Then this must be included in the deed. If you need such customization, please contact the Ligo team. We can be reached by telephone on 020-3031043 and via our online chat.',
    item_16_title: 'What is an ANBI foundation?',
    item_16_text:
      'An ANBI is a Public Benefit Institution. In order to be designated as an ANBI, an institution must meet a number of conditions, such as being at least 90% committed to a public benefit. For example, you can think of a charity or cultural institution. The general benefit must be apparent from the activities of the foundation and is always included in the articles of association. You can request the ANBI status from the tax authorities.',
    item_17_title: 'What are the advantages of an ANBI foundation?',
    item_17_text:
      'An ANBI status is a sought-after good. For example, an ANBI status is required for some subsidy and/or fund applications. It is also attractive for donors to give their money to an ANBI. They can deduct the money they donate to an ANBI from the tax. Moreover, they do not have to pay gift tax on amounts they donate to an ANBI. You will only receive the ANBI status after approval by the tax authorities. The foundation will have to meet certain conditions for this approval. As a result, the ANBI status acts as a kind of quality mark and radiates reliability.',
    item_18_title: 'What does it cost to set up an ANBI foundation?',
    item_18_text:
      "The ANBI foundation must be established with a notarial deed of incorporation. However, we provide a quick and affordable process, so that you don't have to worry about paperwork and can quickly start your business. You can set up an ANBI foundation for as little as €381 (all notarial costs are included here)."
